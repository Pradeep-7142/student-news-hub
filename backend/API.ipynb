      "\"The income tax reforms introduced in the budget are among the biggest in the last decade — simplified and rationalized to put more money in people's hands without compromising the fiscal deficit.\n",
      "The most important change has been the revision of the tax slabs keeping in line with inflation. This has been a long-standing request of the tax payers for the last so many years. In the updated tax reforms, with slabs adjusted for inflation, the 30% tax rate is now applicable above ₹24 lakh, up from the initial ₹15 lakh. This change in the 30% slab marks a 60% adjustment.\n",
      "Under the proposed 2025 tax regime, someone earning ₹25 lakh annually will pay ₹3.43 lakh in total tax, compared to ₹4.57 lakh under the 2024 regime. This translates to 5% more money in hand and a monthly saving of around ₹9,500 — a substantial relief for taxpayers.\n",
      "This rationalisation of income tax has been long-awaited and will go a long way in reaffirming the confidence of the people in the economy. More cash in hand will also mean increased spending, which will drive higher consumption and, in turn, will fuel economic growth,\" says Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar.com.\n",

Point to note that where income is taxable at special rates such as Capital Gains then this tax rebate will not apply.

      "Most of the changes, such as raising the basic exemption limit or increasing the 30% slab limit from INR 15 lakh to INR 18 lakh, are likely to happen under the new tax regime. This is because the government has been encouraging taxpayers to move to the new tax regime, and a large section of taxpayers has already opted for it. To make the new tax regime more attractive, deductions for term insurance and medical insurance premiums may be introduced, as these expenses are necessary for the protection and well-being of the taxpayers and their family, particularly in the post-COVID environment, says Kuldip Kumar, Partner, Mainstay Advisors.\n",

      "“It seems unlikely that the government will completely phase out the old tax regime in the upcoming Budget. While the new tax regime has gained popularity due to its simplicity, the old regime still offers advantages to taxpayers with claims for higher exemptions and deductions. The government may continue to focus on encouraging the adoption of the new tax regime, possibly by making it more attractive, while maintaining both regimes for a transition period,” says Surabhi Marwah, Tax Partner, EY India.\n",

      "“Nearly 72% of taxpayers opted for the new tax regime for FY 2023-24, according to the press release issued by the government on August 2, 2024. Based on the government's past approach, making changes only to the new tax regime seems to be the way to provide relief to taxpayers, as was done last year. A large majority of taxpayers have already moved to the new tax regime, and further changes this year may make it even more attractive for the rest of others who are yet to decide. The top two includes, one, raising the basic exemption limit from INR 3 lakh to INR  5 lakhs and the 30% tax slab to apply for Income above INR 18 lakhs (currently it is INR 15 lakhs). Second, introduce deduction for the premiums paid for term and medical insurance as India is still highly under covered from insurance perspectives,” says Kuldip Kumar, Partner, Mainstay Advisors.\n",

      "“A hike in the 80C limit would encourage more individuals to save and invest in financial instruments that contribute to long-term wealth creation. As the latest hike was only in 2014, it would be welcome increase this limit to boost investments. This could also lead to a higher flow of funds into the formal savings sector, that balance immediate financial relief with sustained economic growth,” says Sudhakar Sethuraman, Partner, Deloitte India.\n",

      "Income Tax Budget 2025 Live: Provide tax rebate up to Rs 10 lakh income\n",
      "The new tax regime has witnessed various amendments since its inception in FY 2020-21, to increasingly make it lucrative for taxpayers. The current tax slabs and rates which were reset in the last Budget, to also account for inflationary trends, provide a boost to the disposable income of the common man. Now, there is also a need for stability and predictability in the tax rates, along with retention and enhancement of the tax base. Hence, with limited tinkering to the tax rates and slabs, enhancing the income threshold up to which a 100 per cent tax rebate is available from INR 7 lakhs to INR 10 lakhs, could help reducing the tax burden for this section of taxpayers, without reducing the tax net, says Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India.\n",

      "Income Tax Budget 2025 Live: Why Section 80C limit may not be hiked\n",
      "Deduction under section 80C of the Act is now available only to the taxpayers opting for old tax regime. This limit has remained unchanged for more than a decade now and has not kept pace with the increasing cost of living. Historically it has been on the wish list, that this limit be enhanced to say INR 3 lakhs from existing INR 1.5 lakhs, to boost household savings and traditional investments such as FDRs, PPF etc.\n",
      "However, considering the thrust towards an eventual phase out of the old tax regime and retaining limited deductions under the new regime, an increase in the Section 80C limit, may now either have limited utility, says Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India.\n",

      "“There is a rise in the cost of living, and high interest rates are prevailing. Further, recent trends in the economy indicate a slowdown. To maintain the growth momentum and spur consumption in the economy, there is a need to increase the disposable income of taxpayers. This can be achieved by raising the basic exemption limit from INR 3 lakh to INR 5 lakh and by raising the 30% tax slab from INR 15 lakh to INR 18 lakh. But this may happen in new regime only,” says Kuldip Kumar, Partner, Mainstay Advisors.\n",

However, any increase is likely to be modest to ensure alignment with the government’s fiscal objectives while still promoting consumption and offering meaningful relief to the middle class,” says Sudhakar Sethuraman, Partner, Deloitte India.\n",

The tax payers in higher income bracket have planned their investments and expenses to avail all deductions / exemptions available under old regime and hence prefer to opt for the same.

      "Many changes have already been made since introduction of the new tax regime.  Further, the following are few changes which are very widely expected in the new tax regime by the common man:\n",
      "1. Currently full rebate of tax is available to a resident individual when his total income as per new tax regime is INR 7 lakhs.  To provide relief to the middle-income group it is expected that the said income limit may be enhanced to at least INR 10 lakhs.  This will generate tax savings (and additional net disposable income) in hands of people earning between INR 7 lakhs to INR 10 lakhs per annum.  It is anticipated that this could fuel consumption in the economy which is beneficial to the economy at large.\n",
      "2. Many individuals do incur significant rent cost on account of working in a different city then their home city.  Hence, an expectation that the house rent allowance deduction be allowed in the new tax regime as well.\n",
      "While the wish list can be endless, the Finance Minister will have to juggle with these expectations along with various macro-economic factors, says Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG in India.\n",

Further, NPS is an important instrument to encourage taxpayers to save for their old age. Therefore, even self-employed individuals should be allowed the same deduction for their contributions to NPS as salaried taxpayers receive when their employers contribute. Further, the NPS Vatsalya, introduced in last year’s Budget too merits a separate tax rebate more particularly for the girl child,” says Kuldip Kumar, Partner, Mainstay Advisors.\n",

The total tax benefit of slab rate changes and rebate at different income levels can be illustrated with examples.\n",
